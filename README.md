# BlackboardGameplayTags
This plugin adds external support for GameplayTag and GameplayTagContainer as blackboard entry types.

Blueprint must use static functions to get/set values (rather than member functions on UBlackboardComponent itself), because this is not integrated directly with UE.

This is intended to be used along with the Flow, AI Flow, and AI Flow Gameplay Tags plugins, but can be used independently, if desired.

This is a "Preview" release.
